# DATABRICKS

## TUTORIAL- https://github.com/dave-007/microsoft-learning-paths-databricks-notebooks/tree/master/data-engineering/DBC


>> show vs. display

```quote

show(..) vs display(..)
- show(. .) is part of core spark - display(. .) is specific to our notebooks.
- show(. .) is ugly - display(. .) is pretty.
- show(. .) has parameters for truncating both columns and rows - display(. .) does not.
- show(. .) is a function of the DataFrame / Dataset class - display(. .) works with a number of different objects.
- display(. .) is more powerful - with it, you can...
  - Download the results as CSV
  - Render line charts, bar chart & other graphs, maps and more.
  - See up to 1000 records at a time.
For the most part, the difference between the two is going to come down to preference.
Like DataFrame.show(. .) , display(. .) is an action which triggers a job.
