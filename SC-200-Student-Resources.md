# SC-200 Delivery Prep Notes

>> Note for existing Azure Passes!

>> There's a trick to this lab in that the tenant is precreated as part of lab, but you have an Azure Pass to activate and associate with the email address provided with the tenant.

>> If you activated the Azure Pass already, as I did, you can add the admin user as an owner on the subscription, then as that user in the portal, change the subscription, changing its directory to point to Contoso.

# PRODUCTS

## Defender for Endpoint

- aka.ms/mdatpdocs

- Endpoint behavioral sensors. Embedded in Windows 10, these sensors collect and process behavioral signals from the operating system. The sensors send the data to your private, isolated cloud instance of Microsoft Defender for Endpoint.
- Cloud security analytics. Using big data, machine learning, and unique Microsoft optics across the Windows ecosystem, enterprise cloud products (such as Office 365), and online assets, behavioral signals are translated into insights, detections, and recommended responses to advanced threats.
- Threat intelligence. Generated by Microsoft hunters and security teams, and augmented by threat intelligence provided by partners, threat intelligence enables Microsoft Defender for Endpoint to identify attacker tools, techniques, and procedures, and generate alerts when these are observed in collected sensor data.

- Conditional Access
